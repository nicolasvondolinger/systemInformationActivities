# System Information Activities
Weekly tasks in C/C++ during the System Information Graduation at the Federal University of Minas Gerais(UFMG).
<h3> Activity 1 - Basic Estructures</h3>
<p> Solves simple equations and receives and performs operations on values given by the user.</p>
<h3> Activity 2 - Procedures and Functions</h3>
<p> Receives values from the user and performs mathematical equations through functions.</p>
<h3> Activity 3 - Selection Commands and Predicates</h3>
<p> Verification of data and performance of functions according to the value of variables.</p>
<h3> Activity 4 - Recursion</h3>
<p> Returns the result of mathematical functions and equations using recursion, that is, the function returning to itself until reaching the desired result.</p>
<h3> Activity 5 - Repetition Structures</h3>
<p> Returns the result of mathematical functions and equations using loops, that is, the function is performed until it reaches the desired result.</p>
<h3> Activity 6 - Files</h3>
<p> Creates files with predetermined values, reads and stores these files in variables to perform functions and equations.</p>
<h3> Activity 7 - Array</h3>
<p> Creates and uses arrays to store various values from a file and assigns these values to functions to return mathematical equation results.</p>
